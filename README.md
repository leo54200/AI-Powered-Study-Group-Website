# AI-Powered-Study-Group-Website
This repository contains my Bachelor's thesis project, focused on developping an innovative web app that supports high
school students’ learning through the use of Large Language Models (LLM). The
web app addresses the problem of generalized classroom learning, instead focusing
on individualized student learning through “virtual avatars” represented by Artifi-
cial Intelligence (AI), offering a stimulating and personalized learning experience.
The project’s database records all user interactions, essential data for training
and fine-tuning machine learning models, as well as providing detailed feedback
to teachers. The technologies used include back-end and front-end programming
languages. For machine learning and AI, we use the OpenAI API, which allows
for the implementation of advanced LLM models and fine-tuning based on the
collected data. Teachers play a crucial role in the web app, acting as evaluators
and correctors of the AI-generated responses. The project aims to improve the
effectiveness of individual study, personalize the review of study topics, and in-
crease academic success by enhancing long-term information retention, improving
assessment performance, and strengthening students’ confidence in collaborative
study.


To visualize this project, you need to download and set up Laravel, then run the following command in the terminal: php artisan serve.
Next, open a browser and navigate to "localhost:8000" to view the project.
Additionally, you will need to copy and paste our SQL script into the "scuola" database on your server and activate it using XAMPP or other application.
